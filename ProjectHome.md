This application automatically sets the rating for all tracks in your iTunes library according to how you listen to them.

Tracks you listen to more will have a higher rating; tracks you neglect will have a lower rating.

This is particularly useful for automatically creating playlists, or transferring only your favourite tracks onto your iPod.
